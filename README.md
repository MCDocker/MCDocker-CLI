# MCDocker-CLI
A simple CLI App to control MCDocker

## Setting up in a dev environment
**Make sure you have the [Core](https://github.com/MCDocker/MCDocker) installed and placed in the same parent directory as the CLI (This will soon change)**
1. Import the project in your code editor
2. Sync all dependencies

## Testing
Go to your code editors `Run Configurations` tab. Type in whatever command you want in the `CLI Arguments` box. E.g `containers list --json=true`
